🌦️ Weather Prediction using Python

This project is a machine learning-based weather prediction system developed in Python. It analyzes historical weather data and current atmospheric conditions to forecast parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and chances of rain.

The project integrates data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling to deliver accurate and insightful forecasts. It uses libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data handling, feature engineering, and model training. Additionally, it can fetch real-time weather data through an API and predict upcoming weather trends for a selected city.
